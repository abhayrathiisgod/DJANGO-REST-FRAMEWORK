Fully functioning web API thorugh which:
  1. request
  2. response
  3. save data in background to database
I have added optional docker containers to simplify the build.

creating a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

You can use your new .env file to store API keys, secret_keys, app_passwords and you will gain access to these in the Django app.
